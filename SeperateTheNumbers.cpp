Separate the numbers
A numeric string, s, is beautiful if it can be split into a sequence of two or more 
positive integers, a1, a2, ..., an, satisfying the following conditions:
1. a_i - a_i-1 = 1 for any 1 <i <=numbers
2. No a_i contains a leading zero.  like 1, 02, 03 are not beautiful
3. The contents of the sequence cannot be rearranged.
